Neural Architecture Search (NAS) on MNIST Dataset

This code implements Neural Architecture Search (NAS) using Evolutionary Algorithms, Random Search and Reinforcement Learning to find the optimal neural networks for MNIST digit classification. 

The best architecture found during the search is displayed at the end, along with its accuracy on the test set. 

Neural Architecture Search automates deep learning model design, saving time and improving efficiency.

Dataset: MNIST dataset (handwritten digits 0-9).

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
tensorflow: 2.16.1, numpy: 1.26.4, scikit-learn: 1.1.2, keras: 3.1.1
